# OCR
Optical Character Recognition Android App using Google Firebase ML Vision API

***IMP Use the Source code given as a reference only.
The code for the applicstion provided here was used to make a Sentiment Analysis engine.
We used Google Firebase ML Vision to extract text from images. The text captured from image was sent to firebase realtime database and it was retrieved from DB by another machine (We used Pyrebase to achieve this) which ran the Sentiment Analysis program (Python NLTK-library) 

Use your own firebase api key and account to make it functional.

**This App uploaded here as of now doesnt have the sentiment analysis part. Its just the OCR part.
